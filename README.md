# Hush MT5 ReadMe File

**Hush MT5** is an advanced Forex indicator developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to identify overbought and oversold market conditions, providing signals for potential trade opportunities.

## How it Works

The **Hush MT5** indicator calculates signals based on the market conditions of a given financial instrument. The indicator uses the `IsOverbought()` and `IsOversold()` functions to determine if the market is in an overbought or oversold state at a specific index.

### Initialization

The `OnInit()` function is responsible for initializing the indicator. It sets up the indicator buffers, style, and arrow properties. It also sets the indicator name, short name, and timeframe compatibility.

### Deinitialization

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the indicator is removed from the chart. It clears the indicator buffers to free up memory.

### Calculation

The `OnCalculate()` function is the main calculation function of the indicator. It receives the necessary data for the calculation, such as price and volume arrays. 

Within the `OnCalculate()` function, the indicator loops through each bar from the `prev_calculated` index to the last bar. It checks if the market condition is overbought or oversold using the `IsOverbought()` and `IsOversold()` functions. If the condition is met, it calls the `GetSignal()` function to generate a signal value, which is then stored in the `SignalBuffer` array.

### Overbought and Oversold Conditions

The `IsOverbought()` and `IsOversold()` functions are responsible for determining if the market condition is overbought or oversold at a specific index. These functions should be implemented with the appropriate logic to check for these conditions. They should return `true` if the condition is met, and `false` otherwise.

### Signal Generation

The `GetSignal()` function generates a signal value based on the market condition at a specific index. This function should be implemented with the appropriate logic to generate a signal value. The signal value should then be returned by the function.
